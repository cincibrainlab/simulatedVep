# Simulated Visual Evoked Potential
This is a function that generates simulated electroencephalography (EEG) data for a visual evoked potential (VEP) experiment. It takes various parameters as inputs and returns a structure containing the simulated EEG data, the average VEP waveform, the time values corresponding to each sample in the EEG data, and information about the channels in the EEG data. It can be used to test algorithms that analyze VEP data or to train machine learning models. The function uses the input arguments to control the characteristics of the generated data, such as the latencies and amplitudes of the VEP components, the number of trials and channels, and the sample rate and trial length.
