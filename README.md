# Simulated Visual Evoked Potential
This is a Matlab code that simulates a visual evoked potential (VEP) with an initial negativity with a latency of approximately 70 to 80 milliseconds (N75), a larger positive component with a latency of approximately 90 to 110 msec (P100), and a large negative component with a latency of approximately 130 to 140 msec(N135). The code includes a baseline prior to the VEP of 150 msec, and 150 trials that are 1 second long.

The code also includes jitter in the latency values and adds realistic noise to the signal. The VEP is more prominent in the posterior electrodes, based on an EGI hydrocel 128 channel net. The code also generates plots to visualize the simulated VEP data.
